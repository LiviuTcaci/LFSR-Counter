# LFSR-Counter
This project implements a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) for 4-bit and 5-bit counters in VHDL, based on FPGA design principles. It allows cycle length selection and includes a control unit, execution unit, and seven-segment display output. LFSR counters are widely used in cryptography, coding theory, and pseudo-random number generation.
